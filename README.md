## About 👷‍♂️

This MD file gives you a full reference of each file and gives a tutorial on how I learned the C language. Just follow week number using weeks index.

I'm not used to creating this type of documents but still for my future reference and hope of something will help someone so, I created this MD file.

I'm also a beginner when I started to write this. so forget some of the mistakes and focus on what you want to know.

My learning is based on weeks, so it was simple to find which kind of file you want and every week has its exercises also check it out 😎.

Some of the references as pdf which I found from the web are also available to hear just [follow this link][reference-folder] to get that.

## Licence 🔐

We are not responsible for any copyrighted content, We used many photos from websites for refrence. So we also included sites link at bottom of this MD file for preventing copyright issues.

All of the c files are created by the author so you can use them as your choice.

Reference pdfs are downloaded from the web so please use pdf files as your reference only.
